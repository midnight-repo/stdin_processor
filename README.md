# stdin_processor (sp)

## Introduction
Advanced stdin/stdout and string manipulation in BASH often requires knowledge of a certain set of tools ("sed", "head", "tail", "grep", "sort", "xargs", "expr","cut", "awk" ...) and going through a couple of help manuals or stackoverflow questions. As it is substancially achievable, it does nevertheless feel less intuitive than OOP which provides string and list methods for complex operations.
This tool aims to improve productivity by providing a simple yet complete toolbox with flexible and intuitive options completed with a wide variety of commands, making any avanced operation as **quick** as thinking about it, as **simple** as a few pipes and **easy to read**.

Please note that this project is still at a very early stage.
Commands included in this tool are not all yet created, and the ones that are may be modified to add some functionalities.

Documentation will be added soon.
## Installation
Using pip or pip3 :
```
pip install stdin_processor
```

Check if successful :
